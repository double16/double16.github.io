I am a seasoned Software Engineer and Cybersecurity professional, holding certifications such as OSCP, OSWA, and CISSP. My career spans various industries, where I have specialized in web applications and automation, supporting organizations' goals with quality software and infrastructure.

Currently, I serve as a Security Engineer at [Security Innovation](https://www.securityinnovation.com/), where I assess the security of web applications, APIs and infrastructure. My expertise includes a deep understanding of technologies like Java, Python, Spring, AWS, Serverless, and Terraform, with a strong emphasis on open-source solutions.

### My Approach

I believe that robust security should be integrated into every stage of the software development lifecycle, from design to deployment. My approach involves using cutting-edge tools and methodologies to ensure that applications are not only functional but also resilient against threats. I prefer working with GNU/Linux systems and command-line programs, as they align with my commitment to efficiency and control.

### Beyond Work

When I'm not working on securing systems or developing software, I enjoy spending time with my family and exploring the outdoors. My favorite animal is the [scorpion mouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_grasshopper_mouse), a small yet formidable creature that kills and eats poisonous scorpions. After each victory, it howls like a wolf.

## Capture the Flag (CTF) Platforms

I enjoy CTFs for fun and learning. It's a good place to try out tools.
