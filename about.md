With over 25 years of experience in the field, I am a seasoned Software Engineer and Cybersecurity professional, holding certifications such as OSCP, OSWA, and CISSP. My career spans various industries, where I have specialized in application security, DevOps, and DevSecOps, helping organizations secure their software and infrastructure.

Currently, I serve as a Principal Consultant at Improving, where I focus on designing, implementing, and securing software solutions that meet the highest standards of security and efficiency. My expertise includes a deep understanding of technologies like Java, Python, Spring, AWS, Serverless, and Terraform, with a strong emphasis on open-source solutions.

### My Approach

Security is not just a job for meâ€”it's a passion. I believe that robust security should be integrated into every stage of the software development lifecycle, from design to deployment. My approach involves using cutting-edge tools and methodologies to ensure that applications are not only functional but also resilient against threats. I prefer working with GNU/Linux systems and command-line programs, as they align with my commitment to efficiency and control.

### Beyond Work

When I'm not working on securing systems or developing software, I enjoy spending time with my family and exploring new advancements in technology. My favorite animal is the scorpion mouse, a small yet formidable creature that kills and eats poisonous scorpions much larger than itself. After each victory, it howls like a wolf.
